### Hello people!

I'm Vinicius a 31 years old developer👨🏽‍💻 with 16 years messing with IT and 3 of them web developing with Ruby and Rails ~(I already developed in C and Java, but I don't want to talk about these previous crimes)~.

Before I become a developer I made a course on [Campus Code](https://www.campuscode.com.br) to learn about Rails with TDD and best practices.

I was invited to work with them after the course in a new project for newbies developers, I paired with a senior developer coding for partner companies and that experience made the difference on the way I look and write code.

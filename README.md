### Hello people!

I'm Vinicius a 90's boy developer👨🏽‍💻 messing with IT since 2005 and since 2017 working with web developing with Ruby and/on Rails ~(I already developed in C and Java, but I don't want to talk about these previous crimes)~.

Before I become a developer I made a course on [Campus Code](https://www.campuscode.com.br) to learn about Rails with TDD and best practices.

I was invited to work with them after the course in a new project for newbies developers, I paired with a senior developer coding for partner companies and that experience made the difference on the way I look and write code.

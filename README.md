### Hello people!

I'm Vinicius a 30 years old developer👨🏽‍💻 with 15 years messing with IT and 3 of them web developing with Ruby and Rails.
Before I became a developer I made a course on Campus Code to learn Rails with TDD and best practices.
I was invite to work with them after the course in a new project for newbies developers.
I paired with a senior developer coding for partner companies and that experience made the difference on the way that I look and write code.
